These Terms incorporate by reference any secondary terms applicable to the specific type of NFT and any particular drop rules applicable thereto, which will also be made available to you at the time you purchase your NFTs.  Please review all such provisions carefully to understand your obligations and what you’re getting when you purchase the NFTs. 

Please read these Terms carefully before you start to use the Website and before you buy any NFTs. By using the Website or purchasing any of our NFTs, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms.

All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Website and purchase of NFTs thereafter. However, any changes to the dispute resolution provisions set forth below will not apply to any disputes for which the parties have actual notice on or before the date the change is posted on the Website.

First BMYC NFT Mint
As part of our Bear Market Yacht Club (or BMYC), we plan to offer 5,555 unique NFTs featuring various bear images, all of which will be minted on the Ethereum blockchain.  Each NFT will be associated with and permit access to the BMYC exclusive Discord Channel.  Note that you will only have access to the Discord Channel for so long as you are an owner of the NFT (i.e., your digital wallet shows the NFT still owned by you, as recorded on the Ethereum blockchain).  
Each person may purchase up to 10 BMYC NFTs only.  
As a promotional offer, we plan to allow 600 BMYC NFTs to be minted for free.  Invites and access to these first NFTs have already been sent on Twitter.  You may not have received an invitation, and are not guaranteed to get one.  You hereby release and indemnify us against any claims or losses you may suffer as a result of having received or if you failed to receive any such invite. 
We reserve the right to hold back some BMYC NFTs for our own collection or to use in other ways, in our discretion.  
We plan to open a page on OpenSea.com featuring our BMYC NFT collection.  You agree that your NFT may be displayed there, and might be viewed by third parties, and agree to this practice.  
What you can do on the Website

It is your obligation to understand how crypto assets work, and you agree that you have sufficient knowledge and skill to purchase and trade digital assets, and that you undertake such purchasing and trading at your own risk.  You release us and hold us harmless from and against any losses you may suffer as a result of your purchase or trade of the NFTs.  You agree that you purchase and trade the NFTs at your sole risk.

What you can do with your NFT
You may browse, and purchase one or more NFTs made available for sale on the Website.  When you do so, you acquire solely the NFT that you purchased, subject to these Terms, and no other rights are guaranteed to you.  You will make these purchases by connecting your Ethereum wallet and minting an NFT with our smart contract.  You understand that the NFTs are sold on a first come, first serve basis with a limit of 3 NFTs per Ethereum wallet.
The token holder will own a single copy of the artwork represented within the NFT only, which you understand and agree may not be the only copy.  You acquire no right to:
•	Reproduce the NFT, except as permitted in these Terms;
•	Generate additional NFTs;
•	Distribute (except for the sale of the NFT as a whole, individually, if you so wish);
•	Publish, except as permitted in these Terms;
•	Display except as permitted in these Terms; or
•	Create derivative works;
in each case, of any NFT, or any portion thereof.
You are permitted to sell your NFT after you acquire it, but please keep in mind that we will charge a royalty on sales of all NFTs (at this time expected to be up to seven percent (7%) prior to calculation of any gas fees, but the amount may change from time to time in our discretion).  
For so long as you are the owner of the NFT, you can post a copy of it to social media pages that you control, and you can use them as your avatar on such social media pages. You can discuss the NFT on social media pages, and the Internet generally, provided you don’t engage in any illegal activity in doing so and don’t disparage anyone associated with the NFTs or the Company, or talk about us in a libelous or malicious manner.  You can display your NFT for personal, non-commercial purposes, anywhere on the public Internet, so long as you do not attempt to create an association between you and the Company, and you don’t attempt to mislead the public as to your relationship with us, or induce people to believe, by act or omission, that you are related to or affiliated with the Company.  
Anyone who acquires the NFT from you is a successor to these Terms, and shall be bound by them.  It is the responsibility of the initial NFT purchaser to ensure these Terms are transferred to any subsequent purchaser, and of each subsequent purchaser of an NFT to ensure these terms are transferred to new secondary market owners of the NFT.  You understand that we will collect a royalty on all subsequent sales of the NFT on the Ethereum blockchain network.  
You Cannot Make Derivative Works
You will not have the right to make derivative works of your NFT, and cannot allow, attempt to or induce others to do so.
Third Party Uses Are Not Restricted
Nothing in these Terms is meant to limit you or a third party from (i) owning or operating a non-fungible token marketplace that permits the use or sale of the NFTs, so long as the marketplace cryptographically verifies the ownership of the NFT to ensure that only the bona fide owner can use and display their NFT; and (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion or involvement of the NFT generally, provided that the website or application verifies the ownership of the NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can use and display their 
NFT. Furthermore, nothing in these Terms is meant to restrict a third party website’s ability to build tools which track traits or sales.

If the Website contains links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, such as Discord and OpenSea, these links are provided for your convenience only.

Limitations of Liability

THESE POTENTIAL LOSES INCLUDE ANY GAS FEES FOR FAILED TRANSACTIONS, ANY EXCESSIVE GAS FEES CHARGED DUE TO WEBSITE OR SMART CONTRACT BUGS, AND ANY LOSS OF YOUR NFT DUE TO WEBSITE OR SMART CONTRACT BUGS.  
THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
The NFTs Are Not Intended as Investments
The NFTs are meant to be a token for you to collect. They are not meant as investment vehicles. We make absolutely no promise or guarantee that these NFTs will be worth anything.

You are entirely responsible for any tax liability which may arise from minting or reselling your NFTs.
Gas Fees
You are entirely responsible for any gas fees charged when minting or reselling your NFTs.

Your use of those sites is subject to the privacy policies posted on them, and we do not control such data collection or use.
Thank you!
We will succeed only with the support of you and the other members of our community. We appreciate you, and sincerely thank you for being a part of our launch. See you on Discord, and happy minting and gaming!
